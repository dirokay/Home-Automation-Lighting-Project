# Home-Automation-Lighting-Project
This is a project meant to use sensors and Arduino to control and manipulate the lighting of a home system. When it's dark, curtains close and lights come ON. Incase there's a clap detected, it turns the lights back OFF and if motion is present the lights come back ON. During the day, lights go OFF and curtains open.
